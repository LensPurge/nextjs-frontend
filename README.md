## ⏳ Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## 👨‍🎨 UI/UX Design

The UI is designed to have a simple user interface. The website got some inspiration from the lens.xyz website.

## ⚙️ Functionality

The website has the core/fundamental functionality of the project. It's responsible for unfollowing the users that the user doesn't interact with.
It also handles all the login (connection with Metamask) and connection with lens.
